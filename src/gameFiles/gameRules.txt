GAME BACKGROUND
-----------------------
Each player represents a large, global company. Each company potentially has a negative environmental impact as they operate; with the requirement of energy to allow their business to operate and in a negative contribution to environmental waste or greenhouse gas emission. 
Companies are accountable to national and international environmental policy.   Companies trade in Renewable Energy Credits (REC’s).   If the company has a positive impact on the environment they will gain REC’s, and if they negatively impact the environment, they will pay REC’s. 
.
RECs are acquired in several ways: 
-Each company starts the game with a certain number of RECs allocated to them 
-Every time a player passes G8 Summit they will gain RECs 
-If a company owns a property that contributes positively to the environment, then another company landing on the associated square will pay them RECs 
.
RECs are lost in the following way: 
When a player lands on another player's square where the other player owns a property, they must pay the associated amount 
.
The game ends when: 
-One player spends all REC’s and therefore their company is unable to operate, and they must stop. 
-Any player decides to quit the game 
-User Interface 
.
Setup 
-The game starts with 2-4 players 
-Each player represents a global company 
-treehugger.Player roles dice and initial number is recorded
-The number for each dice roll for the player is recorded 
-The number is sorted in descending order 
This order of initial dice roll becomes the order in which players will continue to take turns throughout game. 
.
Start and Move 
System will have a start square zonenamed ‘G8 Ssummit’, where players collect their resources  
Each player takes their turn depending on the descending order number 
Each player starts at the G8 Summit squarezone 
treehugger.Dice roll again, in order of player turn
Number generated in dice roll represents number of squares zones moved 
Players will be informed where they have landed 
Players presented with opportunities and obligations  
treehugger.Player makes decision
The system will trigger an action based on the player’s decision 
More than one player can occupy a square zone concurrently 
Each time a player passes the G8 summit they collect 200 Recs’. 
.
Areas Zones and Fields 
When a player initially lands on a squarezone, they can invest in an environmentally friendly resource related to the zone field the square is part of. 
The system will have a ‘rest square’zone’ where nothing happens 
If a player lands on a square zone that is resourced by a facility owned by another player the landing player is obligated to pay RECs as a form of compensation for energy use, or negative impact on the environment. 
System will include four ‘zones’'fields’ 
The ‘zonesfields’ will be divided as follows:  
Two ‘zones’ 'fields’ containing three squareszones. 
Two ‘fieldszones’ containing two squareszones. 
.
Developing AreasFields 
A player must own all squares zones related to each zone field before they can invest in an environmentally friendly resource 
Zones can be developed at the start of player’s turn 
Each zone field will have a designated name 
Each development will have a designated name 
A maximum of two development typess can be made to each tilezone (standard --> upgraded) 
Developments can be purchased using REC’s 
Owners of developments will get paid back RECs on players who land on their squarezone 
.
